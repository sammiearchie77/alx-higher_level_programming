#  0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Requirements

## Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!

## Python - Test-driven development

- 0-add_integer.py, tests/0-add_integer.txt: function that adds 2 integers
- 2-matrix_divided.py, tests/2-matrix_divided.txt: function that divides all elements of a matrix
- 3-say_my_name.py, tests/3-say_my_name.txt: function that prints “My name is ”
- 4-print_square.py, tests/4-print_square.txt: function that prints a square with the character #
- 5-text_indentation.py, tests/5-text_indentation.txt: function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters
- 6-max_integer_test.py: unittests for the function def max_integer(list=[])
- 100-matrix_mul.py, tests/100-matrix_mul.txt: function that multiplies 2 matrices
